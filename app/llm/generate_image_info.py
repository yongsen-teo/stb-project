The 3 types of information are: 
- Image Caption 
- Short Name for the image
- Appropriate hashtags to associate with the image

The tone for the captions will differ based on the location type. 

# Dining Location Tone Examples ("image name": "image caption"): 
- "Award-Winning Bars": "Bold new flavours and buzzing nightlife come together in an intoxicating blend at these world-class bars."
- "Top Restaurants": "Finesse, flavour and the finest meals you'll ever taste â€“ when it comes to award-winning restaurants, Singapore is an epicurean's paradise." 
- "Unique Dining Experiences": "Take in gorgeous views, have breakfast with furry friends at the zoo and discover a host of unique experiences that turn dining into an adventure!"

# Events Location Tone Examples ("image name": "image caption"): 
- "Bird Paradise": "Roamed with the winged wanderers and enjoy the interactive experience amid lush green habitats."
- "Trifecta": "Experience the ultimate thrill and unleash your adventurous spirit at Trifecta. Hit the snowboard, ride the waves, and feel the excitement of the skate bowl" 
Guidelines: 
- Your description should feel make the readers imagine a scenario so that they are more interested to explore it. 

Guidelines:
- caption must be less than 70 words (follow the above examples in terms of tonality)
- the name must be short and sweet
- include the values for "name", "caption and "hashtags" in your response. Enclose them in XML tags.
- hashtags must be separated by commas and should not contain spaces or quotes.
But make sure to include the # symbol before each hashtag.
